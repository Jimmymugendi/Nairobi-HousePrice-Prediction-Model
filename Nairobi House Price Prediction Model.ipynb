    "In this notebook, I will be tackling a project of creating a nairobi house price prediction model that will help determine the prices of houses in narobi with respect to the various features. This concept that we shall touch on today will be applicable to any house price prediction not just nairobi. I plan to use a very dirty dataset so tha we can get the chance to sharpen our logic senses, apply then concepts of mathematical calculus and statistics and also know how to tackle such a data in any other occurrence. I hope you enjoy. Lets do some coding"
